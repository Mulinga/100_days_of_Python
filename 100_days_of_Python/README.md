# 🐍 100 Days of Python

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python** challenge! This is a personal journey to level up from **intermediate** to **advanced** Python through daily hands-on challenges, mini-projects, and explorations of real-world use cases.

---

## 🚀 Goal

To build consistency, deepen my Python expertise, and apply concepts in data structures, algorithms, web development, APIs, data science, automation, and more. Each day I’ll:
- Solve a challenge or build something.
- Document the learnings.
- Push code to this repo.
